<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I will be graduating in December 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in History with a concentration in Humanities from the University of Louisville<br>
    In my time at UofL, I focused primarily on courses in Medieval and Renaissance history and literature.</p>
    <p>In Fall 2021 I completed a research seminar course on the Black Death taught by Dr. Blake Beattie (Medieval History) and Fabian Crespo (Biological Anthropology). In my seminar paper, "Speculation on the Influences of the Eastern Narrative of the Black Death," I employed a variety of documentary sources from Europe and Central Asia to determine possible impacts experienced by Mongolia during the Black Death.
